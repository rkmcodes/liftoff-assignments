### Overview
I am a Codergirl student at LaunchCode Education. In my current course LiftOff we are working on an team project “from scratch”. My team & I have brainstormed an idea to link a lucrative industry to users to through an MVP designed web application. Through this app my team & I will unite, build and grow a thriving community through a clean, fun and efficient user experience. This app will provide an informational service to the user about the quality of local coffee & coffee products. Users will find usefulness through the app’s sorting & filter features as well incentives for user posting. Another useful feature is the unique addiction of information linking companies to fair trade, eco friendly & sustainable production practices. This idea stemmed from a similar approach involving the beer beverage industry. 

### Features

* Search: Users will be able to search for reviews containing a given text.
* Sort: Users will be able to sort through posts using specific filters.
* Create, Edit & Delete posts: Users will be able to create, edit or delete content when logged in. New posts & changes will appear & reflect in their profile.

* Incentive Inbox: Users will receive special rewards for creating new content.
